# Dark-Light-mode-in-website

Just made a simple website having a button in the middle of the page, on clicking the button it turn the dark mode or light mode.

#Basically Here I used the concept of EventHandler in javaScript and toggle class to toggle(add or remove) class having the dark mode theme
